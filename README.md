# AutoReply-Wp-Bot
<br>
<br>
I have developed a WhatsApp bot using Python, integrating libraries such as OpenAI, Pyperclip, OpenCV, Time, and PyAutoGUI. This bot can automatically send messages to the first chat in my WhatsApp application on my laptop. To adapt the bot for different setups, you simply need to adjust the coordinates of the WhatsApp application window to align with your screen layout. Additionally, you'll need to use your own OpenAI API key and refer to the documentation on how to implement it correctly.
